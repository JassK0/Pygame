Adding Sounds (e.g., for Eating or Collisions):
-------------------------------------------------------

a) Prepare your sound files (e.g., coin.wav, bomb.mp3, die.mp3) and place them in the same `game2/` folder.

b) Load the sounds using `pygame.mixer.Sound()`:
   eaten_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound("game2/coin.wav")
   bomb_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound("game2/bomb.mp3")
   die_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound("game2/die.mp3")

c) Play a sound when something happens:
   eaten_sound.play()  # when a point is eaten
   bomb_sound.play()   # when a bomb is hit
   die_sound.play()    # when game over


example:


beep = pygame.mixer.Sound("beep.wav")
the variable beep should be in the top section of the code, where all
other variables are stored.

Then you can use it inside you game loop:


running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            beep.play()

pygame.quit()
