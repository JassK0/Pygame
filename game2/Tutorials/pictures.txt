Adding Pictures (e.g., for Bombs):
-----------------------------------------

To display images like bombs in your Pygame game, follow these steps:

a) Prepare your image:
   - Save the image (e.g., bomb.png) inside a folder like `game2/`.

b) Load the image using Pygame:
   bomb_image = pygame.image.load("game2/bomb.png").convert_alpha()
   bomb_image = pygame.transform.scale(bomb_image, (CELL_SIZE, CELL_SIZE))

c) Display the image in your game loop at a specific rectangle:
   screen.blit(bomb_image, bomb_rect)

In your code, you correctly loop through bombs and render the image:
   for b in bombs:
       screen.blit(bomb_image, b)



example:

top sectionn of your code, where all other global variables are:

bomb_image = pygame.image.load("game2/bomb.png").convert_alpha()
bomb_image = pygame.transform.scale(bomb_image, (CELL_SIZE, CELL_SIZE))



then add to the part where you draw everything else:

    score_text = font.render(f"Score {score}",True,BLACK)
    screen.blit(score_text,(0,0))
    for segment in snake:
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, GREEN, segment)
    for p in points:
        pygame.draw.rect(screen,RED,p)



DRAW YOU BOMB LIKE THIS:
    for b in bombs:
        screen.blit(bomb_image,b)
